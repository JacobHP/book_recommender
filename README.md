# book_recommender

Simple recommender system. I thought it would be interesting to create one for myself, knowing where the data is from to make my own informed decisions about which books I want to read. 

I am a big reader, however always struggle to get started. Understanding what books you may enjoy is vital, far more so than songs for example as it's a significant time commitment to start any book.
